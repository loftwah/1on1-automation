# 1 on 1 Automation

![1on1](images/1on1.png)

This repository is for making 1on1 meetings easy, and automated. It is inspired by a combination of a couple of different related repositories and I have mostly just joined the ideas together.

## Requirements

- Node.js or Ruby
- GitHub token

## Usage

To get started you'll need to add your GitHub token to the secrets in GitHub Actions from within the settings of your repository.

For now, it is just a JavaScript file that is run locally.

```bash
node index.js
```

OR! You can use the Ruby version.

```bash
ruby app.rb
```

> **Note** You may need to install some gems for the Ruby version.
