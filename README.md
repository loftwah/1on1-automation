# 1 on 1 Automation

![1on1](images/1on1.png)

This repository is for making 1on1 meetings easy, and automated. It is inspired by a combination of a couple of different related repositories and I have mostly just joined the ideas together.

I have a video example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpLRhfRjJWQ) of how it works.

## Requirements

- Ruby (if you want to run the script locally)

## Usage

To get started you'll need to add your GitHub token to the secrets in GitHub Actions from within the settings of your repository.

To run locally you'll need to add your GitHub token to your environment.

```bash
ruby app.rb
```
