# 1 on 1 Automation

This repository is for making 1on1 meetings easy, and automated. It is inspired by a combination of a couple of different related repositories and I have mostly just joined the ideas together.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- GitHub token

## Usage

To get started you'll need to add your GitHub token to the secrets in GitHub Actions from within the settings of your repository.

For now, it is just a JavaScript file that is run locally.

```bash
node index.js
```

## To Do

- [ ] Add a GitHub Action to run the script
